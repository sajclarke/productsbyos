    A wife, a mother of four and now the grandmother of nine, Theophilia
    Louisien-Stoute who is affectionately called Offee, is a true Caribbean
    woman. Born in the beautiful island of st.lucia, married to a sweet guyanese
    and living in breathtaking paradise Barbados. Her journey to Barbados was to
    make a better life and to help her mother and five younger siblings, but
    becoming a successful entrepreneur was far from her mind.
